* **Memory Organization**
    * Organized as rectangles of bits called **words**
        * Data transfer to or from memory are done one (or more) word(s) each time
    * Words in memory are consecutively numerated, starting from zero
        * Those numbers are the words **addresses**
        * Addresses are used by processors to transfer data to/from memory
    * **Memory Capacity**
        * Number of words times word size
        * Intel processors use 8 bits words
    * 1 byte = 8 bits
    * Number of words in computer memory is a exponentiation of 2

* **IEC - Binary Prefixes**
    * International Electrotechnical Commission
        * Ki = 2^10 (kibi)
        * Mi = 2^20 (mebi)
        * Gi = 2^30 (gibi)
        * Ti = 2^40 (tebi)
        * Pi = 2^50 (pebi)
* **SI - Decimal Prefixes**
    * International System of Units
        * k = 10^3 (kilo)
        * M = 10^6 (mega)
        * G = 10^9 (giga)
        * T = 10^12 (tera)
        * P = 10^15 (peta)
* 1 kibibyte (KiB) â‰  1 kilobyte (kB)

* **Hexadecimal System**
    * 16 digits
        * From 0 to 9 then from A to F
    * Memory addresses are too big, thus hexadecimal system shorts them
* **Conversion from Decimal to Hex**
    * (1000)<sub>10</sub>  = (3E8)<sub>16</sub>
        * 1000 / 16 = 62 with remainder **8**
        * 62 / 16 = 3 with remainder **14**(**E**)
        * 3 / 16 = 0 with remainder **3**
    * Remainders are taken in the reverse order that they were generated
* **Relation between binary and hexadecimal systems**
    * Dividing by 2 four times equals dividing by 16 once
    * We can separate binary digits in groups of 4
        * Decimal number 1000
            * Binary(Hex digit) 0011(3) 1100(E) 1000(8)
    * Makes readability easier
    * With two hex digits we represent 1 byte

* **Negative Numbers in Binary**
    * **Signal Magnitude Representation**
        * Most significant bit represents the signal
            * 0 for positive and 1 for negative
            * (0101)<sub>2</sub> = (5)<sub>10</sub>
            * (1101)<sub>2</sub> = (-5)<sub>10</sub>
        * Summing gets complicated to the computer
            * **First Case**
                * Positive Numbers
                * Just sum
            * **Second Case**
                * Negative numbers
                * Remove signals, sum both of them and then add the negative signal again
            * **Third Case**
                * One positive and one negative
                * Subtracts the smaller number in absolute value from the biggest one
                    * If the biggest number in absolute value has a negative sign, put it in result too
    * Two's Complement**
        * Representation often used
        * Makes summing easy
            * No need to worry whether numbers are negative or positive
            * Just summing them is enough
        * **Example**
            * 4 bits
            * Cycles between (-8)<sub>10</sub> = (1000)<sub>2</sub> and (7)<sub>10</sub> = (0111)<sub>2</sub>
* **Converting to Two's Complement**
    * **Example** (-108)<sub>10</sub>
        * (108)<sub>10</sub> = (01101100)<sub>2</sub>
        * **Step 1:** invert bits
            * (10010011)<sub>2</sub>
        * **Step 2:** summing 1 to the result of inversion
            * (-108)<sub>10</sub> = (10010100)<sub>2</sub>
* **Subtraction in Two's Complement**
    * (109 - 108)<sub>10</sub> = (109 + (-108))<sub>10</sub>
    * Summing with the two's complement of the number to subtract

* **Assembler Language**
    * General Structure of an Instruction
        * **Label**
            * Gives names to program blocks
            * Are used in jumps
            * Must be alphanumeric starting with letters
        * **Mnemonics**
            * Specifies an instruction
            * Examples: MOV, ADD
        * **Operands**
            * Objects to apply instructions over
            * Instructions with more than one operand separates them with commas
            * Not every instruction has operands
        * **Comments**
            * Started with #
            * Documents the code
            * Particularly important in Assembly

* **Program Example**
    ```assembly
             mov $5, %cx     # contador <- 5
    inicio:  mov $0x25, %ax  # ax <- 25h
             add %ax, %ax    # ax += ax
             dec %cx         # contador -= 1   
             jnz inicio
    ```
