            * 18 thousand valves
            * 4500 calculations per second
            * Inspired Von Neumann to develop the concept of **program stored in memory**
    * **Second Generation - Transistor**
        * 1958 - 1964
        * Transistor
            * Eletronic component created in 1947 in the Bell Laboratories
            * From silicon
        * Advantages over valves
            * Smaller, less heat and don't break with physical shocks
        * Computers 100 times smaller than those from the First Generation
        * More energy efficient and less expensive
        * Programmable in assemble language instead of machine language
        * IBM 7094 (1962)
            * Storage in magnetic tape
            * Punched cards also
            * More than 10 thousand units sold (sales success)
        * The transistor was one of the biggest inventions in modern history
            * Provided the computer revolution
